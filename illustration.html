      <h1>Illustration</h1>
      <p>Illustrations are something that always captivated me as a kid and being able to make them myself now is really fucking cool. I adore being able to take an authors words and imagination and truely make it real. On the flip side, simply being able to create something beautilful and unique is fun too. Being able to make these characters and landscapes is so much fun and usually starts out with an idea that over a couple drafts manifests itself into something worth looking at.</p>
