        <h1 itemprop="name">Illustration</h1>
        <p class="body" itemprop="description">I love illustrations. I think they are integral to any good children’s book, political satire, or holiday card. Illustration is probably the art form I do most option during my free time. I understand that is the case with most art hobbyists but that doesn’t make it any less fun.
My illustrations usually start out the same way, with an idea, a comment, or a “wouldn’t it be funny if?”. From there I tend to make a rough sketch and I develop the bulk of the artwork rather naturally (similar to a painting). The more complex, the longer it takes but the “go with it” attitude usually stays the same. The end goal is always to get the image on the paper to match the image in your head. As long as it gets there it’s successful in my eyes. Here, I have three different illustrations, all if different styles. Yes, I know they all have animals in them, as do other pieces in my portfolio. I don’t know why this is but if I had to guess, I would say it’s because animals are fun to personify, and offer an interesting base of symbolism to create with.</p>
