      <p  class="body" itemprop="description">I was not expecting to enjoy motion graphics as much as I do. Starting out on my art career search, I was adamant that I would not go into animation. I wasn’t artistic enough, I wasn’t skilled enough, there was no way at all that it was going to happen.
So when I found out that I had to do work with motion graphics, I was....confused. I wasn’t looking forward to it at first. I wasn’t expecting to like it. I thought it would be difficult to get into and completely different from everything I had done up until that point.
I am thankful that I was wrong. I thoroughly enjoy making a design come to life. It’s a unique way to add an extra element to a design that you wouldn’t be able to express in any other manner.</p>
