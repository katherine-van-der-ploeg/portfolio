I am a collector of cool things. Nothing in particular, just things that I like. I am addicted to them. I put them on my walls, because I don’t particularly like blank walls, I find they’re stifling and a waste of space. I like that my things give my walls my personality and allow them to flourish into inspirational monuments. The walls make me invigorated and excited, and I am a strong believer that with the right stuff, any space can be like that, whether its paper or a studio. I want to help make things as inspirational as they can be, things that live up to their true potential and make other people go "wow" and perpetuate the addiction I’ve found myself in.
