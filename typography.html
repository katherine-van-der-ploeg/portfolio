          <p itemprop="description" class="body">Ah yes, typography. Before I begin with typography, let me first tell you the story of why I decided I would pursue art as a hobby. I was ten years old and told to create a recycling poster as part of a school project. Interestingly enough, I decided cute fuzzy animals would be the perfect mascots to have on the poster (notice the theme? I think I have a problem). I drew my best foxes, racoons, and deer. About part way through I was insanely proud of my creation and a boy who was sitting in front of me decided to lean over and had the audacity to tell me that I drew some really nice squirrels. It was intended as a complement, I understand this as an adult but at the time it was devastating. From that point forward I vowed to become really, really good at it. Lo-and-behold, eleven years later and its a career. I hated the criticism so much I decided I would shove it right back in their face.
This was the same for typography.
Coming into graphic design I had no fucking clue what typography was. I had to google it. Starting out, I was really bad at it. Project after project I was constantly doing poorly and it didn’t seem to matter what I did I was just not getting it. It took potentially failing my second semester typography class for me to really push myself to understand. I made a typography piece that I could be proud of and I grew from there. I am still proud of that piece and I still include it in my portfolio. Sometimes, I still need to take my time with type pieces but from all of my frustration and persistence I developed an awesome relationship with typesetting and they continue to be some of my favourite pieces.</p>
